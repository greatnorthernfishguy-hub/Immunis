# Immunis System Security

Full-spectrum system security for the NeuroGraph ecosystem. Monitors file system events,
process activity, network connections, package dependencies, system logs, memory patterns,
and peer substrate drift. Learns what healthy system behavior looks like through the NG-Lite
substrate and detects anomalies — including zero-day attacks — by recognizing behavioral
shape deviations.
